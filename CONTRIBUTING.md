# Contributing to meta-linux-mainline

Please review the [Goals and non-goals of this layer][1] in the project README
before opening issues or submitting pull requests.

[1]: README.md#goals-and-non-goals-of-this-layer

Please also do not submit pull requests to update the linux-stable or
linux-mainline recipes to new kernel releases - it is more effort for me as
maintainer to review such pull requests than it is to run the update-layer
script myself.
